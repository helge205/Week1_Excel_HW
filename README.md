# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her Play Fever with a goal to raise $10,000.  But before she begins on this project, she wants information on factors that affect the success or failure rate of other crowdfunded plays so she can make informed decisions.


### Analysis and Challenges
In order to convert the raw data from the Kickstarter data set into a more readable format.  Using a Years function to extract the Yea, I created a new column for more useful info to work with.  I also created pivot tables and charts to visualize the data for Louis to have a quicker and more readable format to look over.  While creating a tab on Outcomes Based On Goals, I ran into type error challenges while writing formulas to create a table for a chart.  A single character mistyped renders the entire formula inoperable.  I learned how each character affects the performance for the formula and the information it extracts.  Taking my time, helped resolve the type errors as well.

### Results

## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The chart shows that the most successful plays were launched during the Spring and Summer months, May having the highest number of successful plays by far.  June and July were also quite successful.  Interestingly, the number of failed plays were generally in the Summer as well, with October also holding a high number of failed plays.  Throughout the year, there were very few canceled plays, with the most being cancelled in January.


## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Overall, this chart shows that generally, the higher the goal is, the higher the percentage in failed outcomes and the lower percentage is in successful outcomes.  Meaning, you may be more successful asking for less money, namely less than $25,000.  It does look like there is an exception where the goal to raise $35,00 - $44,999 were more successful as well.

# Limitations and Recommendations

In order to dig into truly why plays were succeeding or failing, it would help to have data on the methods used for crowdfunding.  The charts also don't take into account the years, simply months.  The year itself may have affected the success or failure of plays launched, whether it be in summer or winter.  
I recommend an additional chart on the years showing success and failures.  Creating a chart showing the genre of play and assessing success or failure may also be helpful for Louise.
